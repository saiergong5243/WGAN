# WGAN

## Abstract
In this paper, we implement two different Generative Adversarial Nets (DCGAN
and WGAN), then train them on both MNIST and SVHN datasets. We evaluate
GANs by tuning different sets of hyper-parameters and comparing generated
images with real images. In the end, we find that both DCGAN and WGAN can
have a relatively good as the number of epoches increases if the loss of generator
and discriminator are close, and we need deeper and more powerful networks with
multiple Convolutional layers to generate more complex images in the real world.
